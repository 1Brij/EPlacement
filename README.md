# E-PLACEMENT MANAGEMENT
Our mini Project about Placement Cell

# Why E-Placement Management?
Since our college don’t have proper website for managing all the activities of the Training & Placement Cell, 
therefore we have come up with an idea to develop an online website which aims to reducing the manual efforts 
spent by the faculty. Also if any company wants to contact our placement cell through college website then they 
don’t find any contact info and other special information like previous placement records. It will also connect our 
Alumni and Students for placement help.


# Features of Our Proposed System:

# Admin: 
The admin will have an authority to add student and company to the system and
provide them valid id and password.

# Student:
Student will be able to update his information such as name, branch,
aggregate marks, contact number, email etc. and also upload their CV.

# Company: 
The recruiter can see the details about the college posted by admin and can   
also see the details of students.

#Alumni: 
There will also be an alumni section where he can share important info
regarding placement help, referrals of student in company etc.

# Resume Builder: 
This will create an automatic resume by taking the details of students or we will give an overleaf template

# Forum: 
Here students and alumni can discuss and get info about any query related to placement.

# Placement Record: 
All the records of students getting placed along with company name, package details etc. will be displayed.

# Internship: 
Here students can check the current internship opportunities posted by the TPO.
